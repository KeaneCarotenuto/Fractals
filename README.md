# Fractals
 A simple Mandelbrot set render using c++ and SFML.
 
Controls:
	Use Arrow Keys [^] to move around the set.
			    [<][v][>]

	Use left [SHIFT] and left [CTRL] to zoom in and out respectively.

	Use [M] and [L] to increase or decrease the render depth respectively.
 
How to use:
	Press [M] a few times when the program starts to add more colour, and see more complex shapes.
	
	Then press left [SHIFT] in order to zoom into the set (The coordinates have already been set to an interesting place)
	
	You can also use the Arrow keys to move around if you want to explore it for yourself.
